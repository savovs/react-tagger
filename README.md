This is a bit like the Stack Overflow tagger. Inspired by Michael Cheng's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE
I strongly recommend watching it because it's awesome.

To use it you need to "npm -g webpack webpack-dev-server" if you don't have webpack.
After it's installed, cd to the project directory and "webpack-dev-server"
it should be live on localhost:8080.

There are other dependencies like Lodash and classNames. When you run webpack you'll see what you need.
