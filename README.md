This is a bit like the Stack Overflow tagger. Inspired by Michael Cheng's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE
I strongly recommend watching it because it's awesome.

To use it, in the terminal, cd to the project directory, "npm install" then "webpack-dev-server".
It should be live on localhost:8080.

It has some dependencies such as Lodash and classNames.
