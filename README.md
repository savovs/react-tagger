# react-tagger
This is a bit like the Stack Overflow tagger.

There's also a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/4kja0p/stackoverflowlike_tagger/) about it.

Inspired by Michael Cheng's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE I strongly recommend watching it because it's awesome.

To use it, in the terminal, cd to the project directory, "npm install" then "webpack-dev-server".
It should be live on localhost:8080.
